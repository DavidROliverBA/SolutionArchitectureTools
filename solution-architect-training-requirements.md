**Bottom Line**: For a training program, you need someone with a **solid technical foundation** (4-5 years), **broad exposure** to different technologies, **strong communication skills**, **systems thinking ability**, and the **temperament** to handle complexity and ambiguity.

They don't need to be expert architects yet - that's what the training is for - but they need the raw materials that can be developed into architecture expertise.

The key differentiator is **aptitude and temperament** over years of experience. A curious, communicative senior developer with 5 years of diverse experience may be a better training candidate than a 10-year specialist who's only worked in one narrow technology stack.

**The ideal candidate combines:**
- Technical competence (but not necessarily mastery)
- Natural aptitude for systems thinking
- Strong communication and interpersonal skills
- Professional maturity and business awareness
- Demonstrated potential for growth into architecture roles
